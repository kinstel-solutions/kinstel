Render blocking requests Est savings of 1,330 ms
Requests are blocking the page's initial render, which may delay LCP. Deferring or inlining can move these network requests out of the critical path.FCPLCPUnscored

Forced reflow
A forced reflow occurs when JavaScript queries geometric properties (such as offsetWidth) after styles have been invalidated by a change to the DOM state. This can result in poor performance. Learn more about forced reflows and possible mitigations.Unscored

Preconnected origins
preconnect hints help the browser establish a connection earlier in the page load, saving time when the first request for that origin is made. The following are the origins that the page preconnected to.
no origins were preconnected
Preconnect candidates
Add preconnect hints to your most important origins, but try to use no more than 4.
No additional origins are good candidates for preconnecting
Legacy JavaScript Est savings of 12 KiB
Polyfills and transforms enable older browsers to use new JavaScript features. However, many aren't necessary for modern browsers. Consider modifying your JavaScript build process to not transpile Baseline features, unless you know you must support older browsers. Learn why most sites can deploy ES6+ code without transpilingFCPLCPUnscored
