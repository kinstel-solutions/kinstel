Act as a Senior Frontend Developer. I need you to create a high-converting Landing Page for my web agency, "Kinstel," inside my Next.js (App Router) project.

**Context:**
We are a premium agency in Lucknow, India. We do NOT use WordPress; we use Next.js + Tailwind. Our USP is extreme speed, performance, and modern tech.

**Tech Stack:**

- File: `app/landing/page.tsx` (or similar path)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Icons: Lucide React
- Design System: Dark Mode, "Cyber/Tech" aesthetic, Neon Green accents (#00FF94) for success/speed metrics.

**Requirements:**
Create a single file export for the page component. The design should be fully responsive.

**Content & Sections:**

1.  **Hero Section:**
    - Background: Deep charcoal/black with a subtle grid pattern.
    - Headline: "Stop Losing Customers to Loading Screens." (H1, bold, white).
    - Subhead: "The Fastest Websites in Lucknow. Custom Next.js Architecture. No WordPress. 100/100 Performance."
    - CTA Button: "Get Your Speed Audit" (Neon Green background, Black text).
    - Visual Element: Create a CSS-only representation of a Google Lighthouse Score circle showing "100".

2.  **The Problem Section:**
    - White/Light Gray background.
    - Text: "53% of users leave if your site takes >3 seconds to load. Most local agencies build slow WordPress sites. We build instant digital assets."

3.  **Comparison Grid (Bento Grid Style):**
    - Compare "Typical Agency" (Red accents) vs. "Kinstel" (Green accents).
    - Rows:
      - Speed: "3s+ Load Time" vs "Instant (<0.5s)"
      - Tech: "WordPress/Templates" vs "Next.js/React"
      - Security: "Vulnerable Plugins" vs "Unbreakable Static Build"

4.  **Services/Stack:**
    - Briefly mention: "Hand-coded for Architects, Lawyers, and High-End Businesses."
    - Display icons for Next.js, Tailwind, React.

5.  **CTA/Footer:**
    - Headline: "Ready to Upgrade?"
    - Button: "Book a Strategy Call"
    - Mention: "Lucknow based. Family owned."

**Tone:**
Professional, authoritative, slightly aggressive on the "Speed" aspect.

**Code Structure:**
Use functional components. Ensure the Lighthouse circle is animated using Tailwind `animate-pulse` or standard CSS transitions. Use `lucide-react` for checkmarks and speed icons.
